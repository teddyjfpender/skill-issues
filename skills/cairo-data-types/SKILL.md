# Cairo Data Types

## Overview
Explain Cairo's core data types, literals, and conversions so answers stay type-correct and safe.

## Quick Use
- Read `references/data-types.md` before answering.
- State the target type explicitly and show the correct literal or conversion.
- Prefer integer types over `felt252` when safety (overflow/underflow checks) matters.

## Response Checklist
- Identify whether the value should be `felt252`, a specific integer type, `bool`, a string type, or a compound type.
- When literals are ambiguous, use a type suffix or explicit annotation.
- For conversions, show `try_into`/`into` patterns and mention potential failure where relevant.

## Example Requests
- "What is the difference between `felt252` and `u64` in Cairo?"
- "How do I write a short string vs a long string?"
- "Why does this integer literal need a type annotation?"
