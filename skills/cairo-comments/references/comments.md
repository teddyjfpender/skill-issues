## Line comments
- Use `//` for a line comment.
- Multi-line comments are written by repeating `//` on each line.
- You can also place `//` at the end of a line for an inline comment.

## Documentation comments
- Use `///` for item-level documentation (functions, structs, traits, impls).
- Common doc sections include `# Panics` and `# Examples`.

## Module documentation
- Use `//!` at the top of a module/file to document the module itself.
