# Cairo Comments

## Overview
Provide correct Cairo comment syntax, including documentation comments for APIs and modules.

## Quick Use
- Read `references/comments.md` before answering.
- Show small examples for line comments and doc comments.
- If the user wants documentation, include `# Panics` or `# Examples` sections where appropriate.

## Response Checklist
- Choose `//` for regular comments.
- Choose `///` for item-level docs (functions, structs, traits, impls).
- Choose `//!` for module-level docs placed at the top of the file.

## Example Requests
- "How do I add documentation comments to a Cairo function?"
- "Is there a module-level doc comment in Cairo?"
