# Cairo Smart Pointers

## Overview
Explain how smart pointers manage memory safely, with a focus on `Box<T>`.

## Quick Use
- Read `references/smart-pointers.md` before answering.
- Use `BoxTrait::new` and `unbox()` in examples.
- Highlight when boxing is necessary (recursive types, large values).

## Response Checklist
- Explain that arrays and dictionaries are smart pointers owning memory segments.
- Use `Box<T>` to store data in the boxed segment and move only pointers.
- Use boxes to break recursive type size issues.

## Example Requests
- "How do I make a recursive enum compile?"
- "When should I use Box in Cairo?"
- "How do I access a boxed value?"
