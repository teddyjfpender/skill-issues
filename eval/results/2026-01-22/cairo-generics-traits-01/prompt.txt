# Prompt ID: cairo-generics-traits-01

Task:
- Write a minimal Cairo `lib.cairo` that demonstrates a generic trait and an implementation.

Requirements:
- Define a generic struct `Pair<T>` with fields `first: T` and `second: T`.
- Define a trait `Swap<T>` with a function `swap(self: Pair<T>) -> Pair<T>`.
- Implement `Swap<T>` for `Pair<T>` so it returns a new `Pair<T>` with the fields swapped.
- Include a small `fn demo() -> Pair<u32>` that constructs a pair and calls the swap function.

Constraints:
- Must compile as a library file.
- No extra modules. Tests are required.

Technical Notes:
- Generic structs need `#[derive(Drop, Copy)]` to work with generic implementations.
- Generic impl must include trait bounds: `impl PairSwap<T, +Drop<T>, +Copy<T>> of Swap<T>`.
- The project's `Scarb.toml` must NOT have `enable-gas = false` (this breaks snforge tests).

Deliverable:
- Only the code for `src/lib.cairo`.
